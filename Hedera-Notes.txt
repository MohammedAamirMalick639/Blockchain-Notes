applications and microservices. 
You can use Hedera’s network services– Consensus, Tokens, Smart Contracts, and 
File Service–atop the hashgraph consensus algorithm, to build applications with high throughput, 
fair ordering, and low-latency consensus finality in seconds without 
relying on centralized infrastructure.


Hashgraph is a distributed consensus algorithm and data structure that is fast, fair, and secure. 
This indirectly creates a trusted community, even when members do not necessarily trust each other. 
Hedera is the only authorized public network to use hashgraph. 
You can learn more about the consensus algorithm.
